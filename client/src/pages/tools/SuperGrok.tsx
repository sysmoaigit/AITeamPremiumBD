      extendedFaqs={[
        { q: "What is the difference between SuperGrok and regular Grok?", a: "SuperGrok is xAI's premium tier at $30/month (vs free Grok). It unlocks unlimited Aurora image generation, video generation, Big Brain deep reasoning mode, higher message limits, and priority access. Regular Grok has very limited image generation and no video." },
        { q: "How many images can I generate with SuperGrok per day?", a: "SuperGrok includes unlimited Aurora image generation — there's no strict daily cap. You can generate as many photorealistic images as you need. Free Grok limits users to about 10 images per month." },
        { q: "Does SuperGrok have real-time access to X (Twitter)?", a: "Yes — this is SuperGrok's killer differentiator. It integrates live X/Twitter data via DeepSearch, so you can research trending topics, analyse public sentiment, and get real-time insights from the X platform. No other major AI has this." },
        { q: "What is Big Brain mode in SuperGrok?", a: "Big Brain is xAI's extended reasoning mode — similar to OpenAI's o3 or Claude's Extended Thinking. It gives Grok more 'thinking time' to work through complex problems step-by-step, making it significantly better at math, science, coding, and logical analysis." },
        { q: "Can I use SuperGrok for video generation in Bangladesh?", a: "Yes. SuperGrok includes access to Grok Video, xAI's text-to-video and image-to-video generator (currently in beta). It can create short clips up to 10 seconds at 720p. This feature is included in both Shared and Personal plans from AITPBD." },
        { q: "Is Grok better than ChatGPT for Bangladesh users?", a: "SuperGrok has specific advantages: unlimited image generation (ChatGPT caps this), real-time X data (ChatGPT has none), and video generation. However, ChatGPT has a larger ecosystem of plugins and custom GPTs. For visual content creators and researchers who need live social data, SuperGrok wins. For document analysis and coding, they're comparable." },
        { q: "What is the DeepSearch feature in SuperGrok?", a: "DeepSearch is SuperGrok's dual-search engine — it simultaneously queries the live web AND live X/Twitter posts, then synthesises both into a single answer with citations. This is uniquely powerful for trend research, news analysis, and competitive intelligence. No other AI tool combines real-time social data with web search in this way." },
        { q: "How does Aurora compare to Midjourney for image quality?", a: "Aurora produces photorealistic images competitive with Midjourney v6 in quality. The main differences: Aurora is included unlimited with SuperGrok (no separate credit system), while Midjourney requires a separate ৳1,200/mo plan and uses a credit/GPU minute system. Midjourney v7 still leads on artistic quality and creative diversity, but Aurora is excellent for photorealistic and social content. For high-volume image creation, Aurora's unlimited nature is a major advantage." },
        { q: "What happens to my X/Twitter account if I choose the Personal Seat?", a: "The Personal Seat upgrades your own X (Twitter) account to X Premium — you get the gold/blue verification badge, longer post character limits, post monetisation eligibility, and analytics. SuperGrok AI features are then activated on that account. If you already have X Premium, we apply the SuperGrok AI tier upgrade. Contact us on WhatsApp to discuss your specific X account situation." },
        { q: "Can SuperGrok handle Bangla language tasks?", a: "Yes. Grok 3 produces good Bangla text — adequate for content creation, business communication, and research. You can write prompts in Bangla and receive Bangla responses. Grok's Bangla quality is comparable to ChatGPT Plus. For the highest Bangla writing quality, Claude and Gemini have a slight edge. Grok's unique value for Bangladeshi users is its real-time X data and unlimited image generation, not Bangla language leadership." },
        { q: "How is SuperGrok delivered after payment to AITPBD?", a: "Shared Seat (৳499/mo): we deliver login credentials within 5–15 minutes of payment confirmation on WhatsApp. Personal Seat (৳3,990/mo): we need your X/Twitter account email and process the upgrade within 2–4 hours. Both plans come with a 30-day replacement warranty and 24/7 WhatsApp support in Bangla and English." },
