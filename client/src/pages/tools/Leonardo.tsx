      extendedFaqs={[
        { q: "How many images can I generate with Leonardo AI Artisan per month?", a: "The Artisan Shared plan includes 8,500 tokens per month. Each image generation costs 7–15 tokens depending on resolution and model. This means approximately 570–1,200 images per month — enough for heavy professional use. The Personal plan (৳1,299/mo) includes 25,000 tokens for approximately 1,700–3,500 images per month." },
        { q: "What is the difference between Leonardo Phoenix and Flux Pro?", a: "Leonardo Phoenix is Leonardo's own flagship model — excellent for photorealism, consistent characters, and product photography. Flux Pro 1.1 (by Black Forest Labs) is better for creative art, illustrations, and stylistic control. Both are available on the Artisan plan." },
        { q: "Can Leonardo AI generate consistent characters across multiple images?", a: "Yes — this is Leonardo's strongest feature. You can train a character element or use ControlNet to maintain pose, appearance, and style consistency across dozens of images. Essential for game development, comic creation, and brand mascot work." },
        { q: "Does Leonardo AI support Bangla text in images?", a: "Bangla text in AI-generated images is challenging for all tools. Leonardo (like others) has limited Bangla text accuracy. For best results, generate the image first, then add Bangla text in Canva or Photoshop. The image quality itself fully supports Bangladeshi subjects and aesthetics." },
        { q: "What is Leonardo Motion and how do I use it?", a: "Leonardo Motion animates any static image into a 4-second video clip. Upload or generate an image, click 'Motion', and Leonardo creates subtle movement — water flowing, hair blowing, lighting shifts. Perfect for Instagram Reels and TikTok content. Available on the Artisan plan." },
        { q: "What is ControlNet in Leonardo AI and why is it useful for designers?", a: "ControlNet lets you provide a reference image for composition, pose, or depth map — Leonardo generates a new image that matches that structure. For example: upload a photo of a model pose → generate a new AI character in that exact pose. For Bangladeshi fashion designers and game developers, this gives precise control over character positioning that standard image prompting cannot achieve." },
        { q: "How does Real-Time Generation in Leonardo work?", a: "Real-Time Generation lets you see images being generated as you type your prompt — updating live with each keystroke. This makes it much faster to explore prompt variations and find the right direction. Instead of waiting 10–30 seconds per generation, you see changes in near-real-time. Available on the Artisan paid plan and excellent for rapid creative exploration." },
        { q: "Can Bangladeshi freelancers use Leonardo AI commercially for client work?", a: "Yes. The paid Artisan plan includes commercial usage rights. You can deliver AI-generated images to clients, use them in advertisements, print them, and monetise them. Many Bangladeshi designers on Fiverr and Upwork use Leonardo to deliver high-volume design work (social media packages, product images, concept art) at a fraction of the manual design time." },
        { q: "What is Leonardo Universal Upscaler?", a: "The Universal Upscaler takes any image (generated in Leonardo or uploaded) and enhances it to up to 4K resolution — adding detail, sharpness, and texture. For e-commerce sellers needing large print-ready images, and for game developers needing high-resolution textures, this eliminates the need for separate upscaling software like Topaz Gigapixel." },
        { q: "Is the Leonardo AI Shared plan enough for daily professional use?", a: "The Artisan Shared plan (৳349/mo) with 8,500 tokens per month generates approximately 570–850 images per month. A Bangladeshi freelancer doing 20 client projects per month, generating 20–30 images per project, would use about 400–600 tokens total — well within the limit. The Personal plan (৳1,299/mo, 25,000 tokens) is for agencies or professionals generating hundreds of images per day." },
        { q: "How do I get started with Leonardo AI from AITPBD?", a: "Message AI Team Premium BD on WhatsApp (+880 1533-262758). We deliver the Artisan Shared plan credentials within 5–15 minutes of payment. Log in at leonardo.ai, and all 20+ models, the Canvas editor, ControlNet, and other Artisan features are immediately available. No additional setup needed." },
