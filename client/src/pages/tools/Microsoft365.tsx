const M365_FAQS = [
  { q: "What does Microsoft 365 Copilot do inside Word?", a: "Copilot in Word can draft entire documents from a short brief, rewrite or improve existing text, summarise long documents, extract key points from any document, translate content, and explain complex sections in plain language. For Bangladeshi business professionals writing proposals, reports, or legal documents, it eliminates the 'blank page' problem and dramatically speeds up document creation." },
  { q: "How does Copilot in Excel help non-technical users?", a: "Copilot in Excel lets you describe what you want in plain English and it creates the formulas, pivot tables, and charts for you. Instead of learning VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH, you type: 'Show me total sales by region for Q3, sorted highest to lowest.' Copilot writes the formula and creates the chart. For Bangladeshi accountants, business owners, and operations teams, this makes Excel data analysis accessible without training." },
  { q: "Can Microsoft 365 Copilot generate entire PowerPoint presentations?", a: "Yes. In PowerPoint, Copilot can generate a full presentation from a prompt ('Create a 15-slide business proposal for a Bangladeshi logistics startup') or from an existing Word document. It selects relevant layouts, adds placeholder content, suggests charts where data is referenced, and applies your theme consistently. The result is a professional first draft you can edit, not a bare template." },
  { q: "What does Copilot do in Microsoft Outlook?", a: "In Outlook, Copilot drafts email replies (you describe the tone and key points, it writes the full email), summarises long email threads (key decisions, pending actions, who said what), suggests meeting times and drafts meeting agendas, and can coach you on email tone ('Is this email too aggressive?'). For Bangladeshi managers handling 50+ emails daily, this can save 1–2 hours every day." },
  { q: "How does Microsoft Teams AI work for remote meetings?", a: "Teams with Copilot transcribes meetings in real-time, generates meeting summaries after the call ends, creates action item lists with owner assignments, and lets you ask questions like 'What was decided about the project deadline?' weeks later. For Bangladeshi businesses with distributed teams (office + remote workers), this means no missed decisions and searchable meeting history." },
  { q: "Does Microsoft 365 work on both Windows and Mac in Bangladesh?", a: "Yes. Microsoft 365 includes desktop apps for both Windows and Mac: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and Teams. Additionally, all apps have browser versions (web apps at office.com) and mobile apps for Android and iOS. For Bangladeshi professionals switching between home and office, all files sync via OneDrive automatically." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Microsoft 365 Shared and Personal plans?", a: "The Shared plan (৳899/mo) provides a seat in a shared Microsoft 365 Business subscription — you get all the desktop and web apps plus 1TB OneDrive and Copilot AI features. The Personal plan (৳3,500/mo) upgrades or creates your own Microsoft account with full dedicated access, privacy, and admin control. For individuals, the Shared plan covers all day-to-day needs; enterprises needing custom email domains choose Personal." },
  { q: "Can I use Microsoft 365 offline without internet in Bangladesh?", a: "Yes. Microsoft 365 desktop apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) work fully offline. Your files are stored locally and sync to OneDrive when you reconnect to internet. This is a major advantage over Google Workspace (which requires internet for most features) for Bangladeshi professionals with inconsistent connectivity or who travel to areas with poor network." },
  { q: "Does Microsoft 365 include Microsoft Access and Publisher?", a: "Microsoft 365 Business includes all core apps — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, and OneDrive. Microsoft Access (database tool) is included for Windows users only. Microsoft Publisher has been discontinued as of October 2026. For the full app list, the Shared plan covers all apps a Bangladeshi business professional needs daily." },
  { q: "Is Microsoft 365 Copilot better than ChatGPT for office work?", a: "Microsoft 365 Copilot has a unique advantage: it integrates directly inside your Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files — you don't need to copy-paste between apps. It also accesses your company's data (if using Business plan): your SharePoint files, Outlook emails, Teams messages. ChatGPT is better as a general AI assistant for open-ended tasks. For pure productivity in Microsoft Office apps, Copilot is purpose-built and more powerful." },
  { q: "How do I get Microsoft 365 Copilot from AITPBD?", a: "Message AI Team Premium BD on WhatsApp (+880 1533-262758) with 'I want Microsoft 365 Copilot'. We'll confirm which plan (Shared ৳899 or Personal ৳3,500) you need, take payment via bKash or Nagad, and deliver login credentials within 2–4 hours. The Shared plan is ready instantly; the Personal plan requires creating or upgrading a Microsoft account." },
