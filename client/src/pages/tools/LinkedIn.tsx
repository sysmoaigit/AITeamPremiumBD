const LINKEDIN_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is the difference between LinkedIn Premium Career and Premium Business?", a: "LinkedIn Premium Career (৳999/mo) is for job seekers — you get 5 InMail credits, full profile viewers list, AI resume coaching, interview prep, and job applicant insights. Premium Business (৳1,800/mo) is for sales and B2B — you get 15 InMail credits, unlimited people browsing, company growth insights, and advanced lead search. Job seekers choose Career; salespeople and founders choose Business." },
  { q: "How do InMail credits work and why are they valuable in Bangladesh?", a: "InMail lets you message anyone on LinkedIn directly — even if they're not connected to you. This is invaluable for reaching HR managers, recruiters, and decision-makers at Bangladeshi and international companies. Unlike connection requests (which many people ignore), InMails are guaranteed to be delivered to the recipient's inbox, with LinkedIn showing your full profile. Used strategically, one InMail to the right recruiter can change your career." },
  { q: "Can I access LinkedIn Learning courses on any topic?", a: "Yes. LinkedIn Learning includes 16,000+ courses in technology (Python, cloud, cybersecurity), business (management, finance, marketing), design (UI/UX, video editing), and soft skills. Courses are self-paced, available in multiple languages (including English), and include quizzes and projects. Completion generates a LinkedIn certificate that appears directly on your profile — a credible professional signal." },
  { q: "How does LinkedIn's AI resume builder work?", a: "LinkedIn's AI resume and profile tools analyse your current profile, job history, and skills against your target roles. It suggests specific improvements: better headline formulations, skill additions you're missing for target roles, richer descriptions for your experience, and endorsement strategies. For Bangladeshi professionals applying to international companies, these AI suggestions significantly improve recruiter attraction." },
  { q: "What is the 'See Who Viewed Your Profile' feature and how do I use it strategically?", a: "Premium Career and Business show you everyone who viewed your profile in the last 90 days — including their name, job title, and company. Without Premium, you only see 5 viewers maximum and the rest are anonymous. Strategically, if a recruiter from a target company viewed your profile, that's a warm signal — you can send them a connection request or InMail immediately while your profile is fresh in their mind." },
  { q: "Is LinkedIn Premium worth it for Bangladeshi students and fresh graduates?", a: "For final-year students and fresh graduates, LinkedIn Premium Career is highly worth it during the job search phase. The InMail credits let you bypass the 'send connection request → wait for acceptance → message' workflow and contact recruiters directly. The interview prep tools and job applicant insight (seeing how your qualifications compare to other applicants) give concrete advantages. Use it intensively for 2–3 months during active job searching." },
  { q: "What job-related insights does LinkedIn Premium provide that Free doesn't?", a: "LinkedIn Premium shows you: (1) Applicant insights — for each job you've applied to, see how you rank vs. other applicants by skills, education, and experience. (2) InMail to the hiring manager directly. (3) Company growth trends — is the company hiring, stable, or shrinking? (4) Who exactly from that company has viewed your profile since you applied. These insights help you prioritise applications and personalise outreach." },
  { q: "Can LinkedIn Premium help with freelancing and finding international clients?", a: "Yes — especially the Business plan. Advanced people search lets you find CMOs, CTOs, and marketing managers at companies that might hire Bangladeshi freelancers. With InMail, you can pitch your services directly. Profile visitor data shows when someone from a foreign company viewed your portfolio. For Bangladeshi developers, designers, and consultants targeting international clients, LinkedIn Premium Business is a powerful BD-to-global pipeline tool." },
  { q: "How does LinkedIn Premium AI interview preparation actually work?", a: "LinkedIn's AI Interview Prep presents role-specific questions based on your target job (you input the role and company type). You record a video or audio answer, and the AI evaluates: your content quality, pace, keyword coverage, and delivery confidence. It then gives specific feedback like 'Your answer lacked a concrete example — use the STAR method here.' Available for hundreds of job roles including software engineering, marketing, and management." },
  { q: "Is LinkedIn Premium delivered to my own LinkedIn account?", a: "Yes. LinkedIn Premium Career (৳999/mo) and Business (৳1,800/mo) from AITPBD are upgraded directly on your own LinkedIn account — you keep all your connections, messages, and history. We need your LinkedIn email address to process the upgrade. Delivery takes 2–4 hours. After upgrade, you see the 'Premium' gold badge on your profile immediately." },
  { q: "Can I cancel LinkedIn Premium through AITPBD after one month?", a: "Yes. LinkedIn Premium from AITPBD is month-to-month — you pay for one month at a time via bKash or Nagad. You can choose not to renew after any month. Since it's a private upgrade on your own account, your LinkedIn data, connections, and history remain intact even if you downgrade to Free. Simply don't pay for the next month to revert." },
