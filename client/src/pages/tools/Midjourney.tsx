const MIDJOURNEY_BASE_FAQS = [
  { q: "বাংলাদেশে Midjourney কীভাবে কিনবো?", a: "AI Team Premium BD-এর মাধ্যমে ৳১,২০০/মাসে shared Midjourney access পান। bKash বা Nagad-এ পেমেন্ট করুন — ৫-১৫ মিনিটে WhatsApp-এ Discord invite পাঠানো হবে।" },
  { q: "Midjourney v7 কী নতুন এনেছে?", a: "Midjourney v7 আগের version-গুলোর চেয়ে অনেক বেশি photorealistic। Character consistency, improved lighting, better text rendering এবং faster generation এই version-এর প্রধান উন্নতি।" },
  { q: "Midjourney Discord ছাড়া ব্যবহার করা যায়?", a: "হ্যাঁ! Midjourney-র নিজস্ব web interface (midjourney.com) আছে যেখানে browser থেকে সরাসরি images generate করা যায়। Discord bot-ও available।" },
  { q: "Character Reference (--cref) কী কাজ করে?", a: "--cref parameter দিয়ে একটি reference image-এর character-কে নতুন scene বা style-এ বসানো যায়। Consistent character design-এর জন্য এটি অত্যন্ত কার্যকর — character sheet, comic, product mockup-এ বহুল ব্যবহৃত।" },
  { q: "Shared Midjourney account কি safe?", a: "হ্যাঁ। Shared account-এ আপনার generated images আপনার নিজস্ব gallery-তে থাকে। অন্য users শুধু public gallery-তে দেখতে পারে (যদি Stealth mode না থাকে)। বাংলাদেশে হাজারো ডিজাইনার এই পদ্ধতিতে ব্যবহার করছেন।" },
];

const MIDJOURNEY_EXTENDED_FAQS = [
  { q: "How many images can I generate per month with the Midjourney Shared plan?", a: "The Midjourney Shared plan from AITPBD gives you approximately 200 fast-generation images per month (based on Standard tier allocation). With Turbo Mode enabled, generations are faster but consume more GPU minutes. Relax mode (slower, queued) gives unlimited additional images. For most professional use cases including freelance design work and social media content, 200+ fast images per month is more than sufficient." },
  { q: "What is the Style Reference (--sref) parameter in Midjourney?", a: "--sref lets you provide a reference image to define the visual style for your generation. For example: upload a specific painting style → all new generations will adopt that colour palette, brushwork, and aesthetic. This is essential for brand consistency — generate unlimited images that all match the same visual identity. Combined with --cref (character reference), you can create entire consistent visual universes." },
  { q: "Can Midjourney generate text inside images accurately?", a: "Midjourney v7 has significantly improved text rendering in images compared to earlier versions, but it's still not as reliable as Imagen 4 (Google) for accurate text. For images where text must be exact (logos with specific words, signs, etc.), generate the image in Midjourney first, then add text overlays in Canva or Photoshop. For stylistic or slightly imperfect text (street signs, book spines), Midjourney v7 handles it well." },
  { q: "What is the Vary (Region) feature in Midjourney?", a: "Vary (Region) is Midjourney's inpainting tool — you select a specific area of a generated image and describe what you want to change, without affecting the rest. For example: generate a portrait, then use Vary (Region) to change just the background, or swap the shirt colour, or modify a facial expression. This gives precise control over specific elements without regenerating the entire image." },
  { q: "Is Midjourney better than Leonardo AI for professional work?", a: "They excel in different areas. Midjourney v7 is the industry gold standard for artistic quality, photorealism, and creative diversity — the tool most professional photographers, art directors, and creative agencies use as their primary tool. Leonardo AI has more technical tools (ControlNet, real-time generation, 3D textures) and is better for game assets and e-commerce product consistency. For pure image quality and artistic work, Midjourney wins. For technical image workflows, Leonardo is stronger." },
  { q: "Can Bangladeshi designers use Midjourney commercially for client work?", a: "Yes. Paid Midjourney plans include commercial usage rights — you can use generated images for client projects, sell designs, use in advertising, and create commercial products. The only restriction is you cannot claim copyright ownership over the raw AI-generated image (the copyright status of pure AI art is still legally evolving globally), but you can use the images commercially for any project. Many Bangladeshi designers on Fiverr and Upwork build entire businesses using Midjourney." },
