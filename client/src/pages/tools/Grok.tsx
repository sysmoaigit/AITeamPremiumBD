const GROK_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is SuperGrok and how is it different from regular Grok?", a: "SuperGrok ($30/month from xAI) is the premium tier that unlocks unlimited Aurora image generation, video generation with Grok Video, Big Brain deep reasoning mode, and higher message limits. Regular Grok is limited to 10 images/month with no video. AITPBD sells SuperGrok Shared at ৳499/month." },
  { q: "How many images can I generate with Grok/SuperGrok?", a: "With the SuperGrok Shared plan (৳499/mo), you get unlimited Aurora image generation — no daily or monthly cap. Aurora produces photorealistic, high-resolution images comparable to Midjourney and DALL·E 3." },
  { q: "Does Grok/SuperGrok have real-time X (Twitter) data?", a: "Yes — this is Grok's unique killer feature. DeepSearch integrates live X/Twitter data with full web search, giving you real-time social media intelligence that ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini cannot provide." },
  { q: "What is Grok Think mode and when should I use it?", a: "Think mode is Grok's extended reasoning system — similar to ChatGPT's o4-mini or Claude's Extended Thinking. When you enable Think mode, Grok takes more time to reason through a problem step-by-step before answering. Use it for complex math, scientific problems, coding architecture decisions, and any task where accuracy matters more than speed. In Think mode, Grok shows its reasoning process, which you can follow and learn from." },
  { q: "How is Grok's Aurora image quality compared to Midjourney?", a: "Aurora produces photorealistic images at a quality level competitive with Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3. The main advantage of Aurora over Midjourney is that it's included unlimited in the SuperGrok plan — you don't need to manage GPU minutes or credits. For artistic/stylistic work, Midjourney v7 still has a slight quality edge. For photorealistic images where unlimited volume matters, Aurora is the better value proposition." },
  { q: "Can SuperGrok generate videos?", a: "Yes. SuperGrok includes Grok Video — xAI's text-to-video and image-to-video generator (currently in beta). It produces short clips typically 5–10 seconds. This feature is evolving rapidly. Both Shared and Personal SuperGrok plans from AITPBD include Grok Video access, though the beta nature means occasional feature updates and changes." },
  { q: "What is the 1M token context window useful for in Bangladesh?", a: "The 1,000,000 token context window means you can paste an entire codebase (hundreds of files), a full book, multiple research papers, or months of business documents into a single Grok conversation. For Bangladeshi developers reviewing large legacy codebases, researchers analysing entire dissertation libraries, or businesses feeding historical transaction data — this massive context changes what's possible with AI." },
  { q: "Does Grok understand Bangla language well?", a: "Grok 3 produces good Bangla text — better than early versions of Grok. You can write prompts in Bangla and receive Bangla responses. For Bangladeshi users, Grok's Bangla quality is on par with ChatGPT Plus. However, for superior Bangla academic writing, Claude and Gemini still have a slight edge. Grok's strength is in its real-time data access and image generation, not Bangla language leadership." },
  { q: "Is the Grok Personal Seat worth it vs Shared?", a: "The Personal Seat (৳3,990/mo) activates SuperGrok on your own X/Twitter account — giving you the Premium badge on X, full tweet analytics, longer post visibility, and the most private AI usage. The Shared plan (৳499/mo) gives full SuperGrok AI features (Grok 3, Aurora, Grok Video) without the X account upgrade. For most AI users, the Shared plan at ৳499 provides excellent value. For active Twitter/X power users who also want the X Premium benefits, the Personal plan makes sense." },
  { q: "How is SuperGrok delivered from AITPBD?", a: "For the Shared plan (৳499/mo): we deliver credentials within 5–15 minutes of payment confirmation on WhatsApp. For the Personal plan (৳3,990/mo): we need your X/Twitter account email and process the SuperGrok upgrade within 2–4 hours. Both plans come with a 30-day replacement warranty and 24/7 WhatsApp support in Bangla and English." },
  { q: "Is Grok better than ChatGPT for Bangladesh users?", a: "SuperGrok has specific advantages: unlimited Aurora image generation (ChatGPT limits this), real-time X/Twitter data intelligence (no ChatGPT equivalent), and Grok Video generation. ChatGPT has a larger ecosystem of custom GPTs, plugins, and Canvas. For visual content creators and social media researchers who need live X data, SuperGrok wins on unique features. For document analysis, coding workflows, and general AI tasks, ChatGPT and Claude remain strong alternatives." },
