const PERPLEXITY_FAQS = [
  { q: "What makes Perplexity Pro different from just using Google?", a: "Google shows you a list of links — you still have to read every page yourself. Perplexity Pro reads the top sources, synthesises the key information, and gives you a cited answer in seconds. With Deep Research, it goes further — autonomously searching 30+ sources and writing a comprehensive report. Think of it as Google + a research assistant working together." },
  { q: "Which AI models can I access with Perplexity Pro?", a: "Perplexity Pro lets you switch between: Sonar Pro (Perplexity's own model), OpenAI's o4-mini and GPT-4.5, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro — all from one interface. This means you get the equivalent of 4 AI subscriptions in one, making it extremely cost-effective for power users who want to compare model outputs." },
  { q: "What is Perplexity Deep Research and how is it different from regular search?", a: "Deep Research is Perplexity's autonomous research agent. You give it a complex research question, and it autonomously runs dozens of searches, evaluates sources, synthesises findings, and writes a structured report — typically 500–2,000 words with citations. This takes 2–5 minutes but produces work that would take a professional researcher hours. Perfect for thesis research, market analysis, and investment due diligence." },
  { q: "Can I upload documents and ask Perplexity questions about them?", a: "Yes. Perplexity Pro allows unlimited file uploads — PDFs, spreadsheets, Word documents, and images. You can ask questions about the document content and Perplexity will answer with citations from the specific sections of your uploaded file. This is useful for analysing research papers, business reports, contracts, and textbooks." },
  { q: "Does Perplexity Pro work well for Bangla language searches?", a: "Perplexity Pro handles Bangla searches reasonably well — you can ask questions in Bangla and receive answers in Bangla with citations. For research on Bangladesh-specific topics (economy, politics, culture), Perplexity often finds more relevant recent sources than ChatGPT since it searches the live web. However, for purely Bangla writing tasks, Claude or ChatGPT may produce more natural prose." },
  { q: "What is the Perplexity Assistant feature?", a: "Perplexity Assistant is a voice-based AI mode available on iOS and Android. You ask questions by speaking and Perplexity responds conversationally — it's designed to be your always-on research assistant. Unlike Siri or Google Assistant, it gives you full Perplexity-quality answers with sources, not just quick lookups." },
  { q: "How does Perplexity handle accuracy compared to ChatGPT?", a: "Perplexity is specifically designed to minimise hallucinations by grounding every answer in cited web sources. ChatGPT sometimes generates plausible-sounding but incorrect 'facts' from its training data. Perplexity's answers link to real sources you can verify. For research where accuracy is critical (medical, legal, financial, academic), Perplexity's citation model is a significant advantage." },
  { q: "Can Perplexity Pro create charts and visualisations?", a: "Yes. When you ask data-related questions, Perplexity Pro can auto-generate charts, timelines, and comparison tables directly in the answer. For example, ask about 'Bangladesh GDP growth 2015–2025' and Perplexity can show you a chart alongside the cited statistics. This feature sets it apart from text-only AI chat tools." },
  { q: "How many searches can I do per day with Perplexity Pro?", a: "Perplexity Pro Shared (৳599/mo) gives you 300+ Pro searches per day — enough for the heaviest research workflows. Deep Research queries count as multiple searches (typically 5–10) due to their complexity. Normal web-grounded searches have virtually no limit for reasonable usage." },
  { q: "Is Perplexity Pro useful for software developers in Bangladesh?", a: "Absolutely. Perplexity Pro is a developer's research superpower — you can ask technical questions and get answers grounded in official documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub, and dev blogs. Unlike ChatGPT which might give outdated code examples, Perplexity searches current docs. Ask about Next.js 15, Python 3.13, or any framework released after ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff and Perplexity gives you current answers." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Sonar Pro and other models in Perplexity?", a: "Sonar Pro is Perplexity's own model — optimised specifically for web-search-grounded answers. It's the fastest option and best for general research questions. The alternative models (GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) are better for creative writing, complex reasoning, and tasks requiring more nuanced language generation. You can switch between models in settings." },
