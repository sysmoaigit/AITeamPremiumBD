const GEMINI_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is the difference between Gemini Advanced and the free Gemini?", a: "Free Gemini uses Gemini 2.0 Flash with a 32K context window, no image generation, no video generation, and very limited usage. Gemini Advanced gives you Gemini 2.5 Pro Ultra with a 1,000,000 token context window, Deep Research, Imagen 4 image generation, Veo 2 video generation, and unlimited usage for normal workloads." },
  { q: "What is Gemini Deep Research and how does it work?", a: "Deep Research is Gemini's autonomous research mode. You give it a research question, and it independently searches 30+ web sources, evaluates them, and synthesises a comprehensive report with citations — similar to hiring a research assistant. It takes 2–5 minutes but produces work that would take hours manually. Perfect for Bangladeshi students, journalists, and business analysts." },
  { q: "Can Gemini Advanced generate images? How many per day?", a: "Yes. Gemini Advanced includes Imagen 4 — Google's best text-to-image model. You can generate approximately 50 high-quality images per day. Imagen 4 excels at photorealism, accurate text rendering within images (a weakness for most AI), and following complex style instructions. Best for product photos, social media graphics, and marketing materials." },
  { q: "What is Gemini Live and can I use it in Bangla?", a: "Gemini Live is a real-time voice conversation mode — you speak to Gemini and it responds naturally, almost like a phone call. It supports Bangla voice input and output. Use cases include English speaking practice, business presentation rehearsal, interview prep, and hands-free AI assistance while multitasking. Available on Android and iOS." },
  { q: "Does Gemini Advanced work inside Gmail and Google Docs in Bangladesh?", a: "Yes — this is Gemini Advanced's killer feature for office workers. With the Personal Seat plan, Gemini integrates directly into Gmail (auto-draft replies, summarise threads), Google Docs (generate content, improve writing), Google Sheets (create formulas, analyse data), Google Slides (generate presentations), and Google Meet (meeting transcripts and summaries)." },
  { q: "What is the 1 million token context window in practical terms?", a: "1 million tokens ≈ approximately 750,000 words. This means you can upload and analyse an entire book (or multiple books), a large codebase with hundreds of files, years of business documents, or a lengthy audio/video transcript in a single conversation. ChatGPT handles 128K tokens and Claude Pro handles 200K — Gemini Advanced has by far the largest context." },
  { q: "Does the Personal plan include 2TB Google Drive storage?", a: "Yes. The Gemini Advanced Personal Seat (৳2,300/mo) upgrades your own Google account and includes 2TB of Google Drive storage — up from the free 15GB. This is shared across Gmail, Drive, and Google Photos. It's the equivalent of Google One AI Premium, which costs $19.99/month internationally." },
  { q: "Can Gemini Advanced generate videos with Veo 2?", a: "Yes. Veo 2 is Google DeepMind's professional video generation model — capable of creating 8-second 1080p video clips with camera movement control (pan, zoom, dolly). You can do text-to-video and image-to-video. Approximately 5 videos per day are included. For Bangladeshi YouTubers and ad agencies, this eliminates expensive stock footage purchases." },
  { q: "What is NotebookLM and why is it useful for Bangladesh students?", a: "NotebookLM is a separate Google AI tool that reads your documents and lets you ask questions about them, create summaries, and generate 'Audio Overviews' — AI podcast-style discussions of your uploaded material. You can upload research papers, textbooks, lecture notes, and get instant answers. With Gemini Advanced, you get NotebookLM's enhanced features including unlimited notebooks." },
  { q: "Is Gemini Advanced good at Bangla language tasks?", a: "Yes — Gemini 2.5 Pro produces excellent Bangla text, matching or exceeding ChatGPT Plus for Bangla quality. Google's language models are trained on extensive multilingual data including Bangla. For Bangla document translation, content writing, and academic work in Bangla, Gemini is one of the top choices alongside ChatGPT." },
  { q: "How do I receive my Gemini Advanced access after paying on WhatsApp?", a: "For the Shared Seat (৳449/mo): we send you login credentials within 5–15 minutes of payment confirmation. For the Personal Seat (৳2,300/mo): we need your Google email address and process the upgrade to your account within 2–4 hours. You'll receive a Google notification confirming the Gemini Advanced upgrade." },
