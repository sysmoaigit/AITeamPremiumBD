const ELEVENLABS_FAQS = [
  { q: "How many videos can I narrate with the ElevenLabs Creator 100K character plan?", a: "100,000 characters per month translates to approximately 10–12 typical YouTube video scripts (each 7,000–10,000 characters), 15+ podcast episodes (each ~5,000 characters), or unlimited short-form social media content. For a Bangladesh-based YouTuber posting 2–3 videos per week, the 100K character plan is more than sufficient." },
  { q: "Can ElevenLabs generate Bangla (Bengali) voices?", a: "Yes. ElevenLabs has dedicated Bangla language support with voices trained on authentic Bangladeshi speech patterns. The voice quality is natural-sounding for both formal and conversational Bangla. You can generate content in Bangla script and the model handles pronunciation, intonation, and typical Bangladeshi speech rhythm correctly." },
  { q: "How does ElevenLabs Voice Cloning work?", a: "Voice Cloning requires just a 30-second to 1-minute clean audio sample (no background noise). Upload it to ElevenLabs, name your voice, and it's ready to use. Generate unlimited text-to-speech in that cloned voice. For businesses, this means a founder or spokesperson can record their voice once and it can be used for unlimited future content without re-recording." },
  { q: "What is ElevenLabs Video Dubbing?", a: "ElevenLabs Dubbing Studio takes any video (upload or URL), translates the script, generates voiceover in the target language using a matching voice profile, and produces a dubbed video with lip-sync-ready audio. Available for 32+ language pairs. A Bangladeshi content creator can take an English YouTube video and produce a Bangla-dubbed version automatically." },
  { q: "Can I build apps with ElevenLabs API?", a: "Yes. ElevenLabs has a full REST API with SDKs for Python, JavaScript, and other languages. Developers can build: voice chatbots, interactive audio apps, narrated reading apps, language learning tools, and more. The API supports real-time text-to-speech streaming with very low latency (~300ms). This is how ElevenLabs powers many commercial AI voice applications." },
  { q: "What is ElevenLabs Sound Effects generator?", a: "ElevenLabs also generates sound effects from text descriptions — not just voices. Describe a sound (e.g., 'heavy rain on a tin roof in Bangladesh', 'busy Dhaka street market ambience') and ElevenLabs generates a realistic audio clip. Perfect for video producers, game developers, and podcast creators who need unique sound design." },
  { q: "How good is the ElevenLabs voice quality compared to human voice artists?", a: "ElevenLabs' premium voices are widely considered the closest to human-sounding AI speech available. Many YouTube viewers cannot tell the difference between ElevenLabs narration and a real voice artist. The key advantages are: zero recording cost, instant generation, unlimited retakes, and consistent tone across months of content. For most content creation purposes, ElevenLabs quality is commercially sufficient." },
  { q: "Is ElevenLabs content commercially licensed?", a: "Yes. The Creator plan includes full commercial rights — you can monetise YouTube content, use voiceovers in client videos, sell podcasts, and use audio in advertisements. The only restriction is you cannot resell ElevenLabs voiceovers directly as a standalone voice service without their Enterprise agreement." },
  { q: "What is the difference between ElevenLabs Creator Shared and Personal plans?", a: "The Shared plan (৳699/mo) gives you access via a shared account — you get the full Creator feature set (100K characters, all voices, voice cloning, commercial rights) but share the account infrastructure with other users. The Personal plan (৳2,500/mo) upgrades your own ElevenLabs account — fully private, your voice clones are only visible to you, and you get 500K characters per month for heavy professional use." },
  { q: "Can ElevenLabs narrate long documents like books or reports?", a: "Yes. ElevenLabs can convert any text to audio — including long documents, chapters, and full books. With 100K characters per month (Creator plan), you can narrate approximately 70,000–80,000 words, which is a full-length non-fiction book. For academics or publishers creating audio versions of research papers, ElevenLabs is the most cost-effective professional solution." },
  { q: "How is ElevenLabs delivered and can I use it immediately?", a: "After payment confirmation on WhatsApp, we deliver ElevenLabs Creator credentials within 5–15 minutes (Shared plan) or 2–4 hours (Personal plan). You log in at elevenlabs.io, and all Creator features are immediately available — no additional setup or downloads needed. The platform is browser-based and works on any device." },
