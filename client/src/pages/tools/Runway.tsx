      extendedFaqs={[
        { q: "How many videos can I generate per month with Runway Standard (৳999)?", a: "Runway Standard gives 625 credits per month. Each 5-second video clip at 720p uses about 10 credits. This means approximately 60 five-second clips per month. For 10-second clips, it's about 30 per month. The Pro plan (৳2,999/mo, 2,250 credits) generates ~225 five-second clips per month." },
        { q: "What is the difference between Gen-3 Alpha and Gen-4 Turbo in Runway?", a: "Gen-4 Turbo is Runway's latest and most advanced model — faster, higher quality, and more accurately follows complex prompts. Gen-3 Alpha was the previous generation. The Shared plan from AITPBD gives access to Gen-4 Turbo, giving you the best quality available." },
        { q: "Can Runway ML remove backgrounds from videos without a green screen?", a: "Yes. Runway's AI Background Removal works on any video footage — it precisely separates the foreground subject from background without needing a physical green screen or studio setup. For Bangladeshi content creators who don't have studio equipment, this allows professional-looking virtual backgrounds on any video." },
        { q: "What is Act One in Runway and how does it work?", a: "Act One is Runway's character animation feature. You record yourself (or an actor) performing expressions, gestures, and movements on video. Act One transfers those movements onto an AI-generated character. For game developers, animators, and filmmakers in Bangladesh, this enables professional character animation without motion capture equipment." },
        { q: "Is Runway Gen-4 Turbo better than Sora (OpenAI) for video quality?", a: "Both are professional-grade tools. The key differences: Runway has more professional editing tools (inpainting, motion tracking, background removal, Act One) which make it a complete post-production platform. Sora supports longer clips (up to 60 seconds vs Runway's 10 seconds). For full video production workflows, Runway wins. For longer single clips, Sora has an edge." },
        { q: "Can Bangladeshi filmmakers and ad agencies use Runway professionally?", a: "Absolutely. Runway is used in Hollywood productions and major international advertising campaigns. Bangladeshi production houses and ad agencies can use Runway to: generate B-roll and establishing shots without location filming, add VFX to live footage, create animated explainer videos, and produce social media ad content. The Standard plan (৳999/mo) covers most agency needs." },
        { q: "Does Runway support image-to-video animation?", a: "Yes. Image-to-video is one of Runway's most popular features. Upload any image (product photo, portrait, landscape, AI-generated image) and Runway animates it into a video clip — camera movements, environmental effects like wind or water, and subject motion. Perfect for e-commerce product videos from static product photography." },
        { q: "What does video-to-video restyle mean in Runway?", a: "Video-to-video restyle lets you take an existing video and transform its visual style with AI. For example: take a standard live-action video and restyle it to look like a watercolour painting, cyberpunk animation, or film noir — while preserving the original motion and composition. Used in music videos, art projects, and brand content." },
        { q: "Can Runway upscale low-quality videos to 4K?", a: "Yes, on the Pro plan (৳2,999/mo). Runway's video upscaler takes 480p or 720p footage and enhances it to up to 4K — adding detail and sharpness. Useful for Bangladeshi content creators who have older archival footage or phone camera recordings that need to look professional for modern platforms." },
        { q: "How is Runway delivered from AITPBD?", a: "The Shared plan (৳999/mo) provides Runway Standard account credentials within 5–15 minutes of WhatsApp payment confirmation. The Personal Pro plan (৳2,999/mo) is set up on your own Runway account within 2–4 hours. Both plans come with a 30-day replacement warranty and 24/7 WhatsApp support in Bangla and English." },
        { q: "What is the minimum video clip length I can generate in Runway?", a: "Runway Gen-4 Turbo generates video clips with a minimum of approximately 4 seconds and up to 10 seconds per generation. You can concatenate multiple clips in video editing software to create longer videos. For a 60-second ad, you would generate 6–10 clips and edit them together — this is standard workflow for Runway-based production." },
