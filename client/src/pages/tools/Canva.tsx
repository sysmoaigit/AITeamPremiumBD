const CANVA_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is the difference between Canva Free and Canva Pro?", a: "Canva Free gives you about 250,000 free templates and basic tools. Canva Pro unlocks 610,000+ premium templates (updated daily), 100M+ premium stock photos and videos, the background remover, Magic Eraser, Dream Lab AI image generation, Brand Kit, social media scheduler, and unlimited cloud storage. Pro is roughly 10× more powerful than Free." },
  { q: "What is Canva Dream Lab and how does it work?", a: "Dream Lab is Canva's advanced AI image generator built directly into the design editor. Type a description, choose a style (photo, illustration, 3D, painting, etc.), and Dream Lab generates custom images you can immediately drop into your design. Unlike Midjourney (which requires Discord), Dream Lab works inside your existing Canva workflow." },
  { q: "How does the Canva Pro Team Seat work from AITPBD?", a: "We send you an official team invitation to your existing Canva account. You accept the invite and immediately get all Pro features — you keep your existing designs, account history, and folders. There's no new account to create. The team seat is official and delivered within 5–15 minutes of payment on WhatsApp." },
  { q: "Can I use Canva Pro for commercial client work in Bangladesh?", a: "Yes. Canva Pro includes a commercial licence for all premium assets — stock photos, videos, audio, and templates. You can use Pro designs for client projects, sell them, and use them in advertising. The only restriction is you cannot resell the stock assets themselves (e.g., create a stock photo website using Canva images)." },
  { q: "What is the Canva Brand Kit and why is it important for businesses?", a: "Brand Kit lets you upload your logo, set your brand colours, and select your brand fonts. Every new design automatically uses these brand elements — team members can't accidentally use wrong colours or fonts. For Bangladeshi businesses managing consistent branding across social media, print materials, and presentations, this is a massive time-saver." },
  { q: "Does Canva Pro include video editing?", a: "Yes. Canva Pro includes a full video editor — you can trim, cut, add transitions, add text overlays, include background music (from 1M+ audio tracks), and use AI-powered video features. You can also create animated presentations, short social videos, YouTube intros, and Instagram Reels directly in Canva." },
  { q: "Can I schedule social media posts with Canva Pro?", a: "Yes. Canva Pro includes a built-in social media scheduler. Design your post in Canva, then schedule it to publish automatically to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and more — up to 8 platforms simultaneously. No need for separate tools like Buffer or Hootsuite for basic scheduling." },
  { q: "How many people can share one Canva Pro team seat?", a: "For the Team Seat plan (৳350/mo), the seat is added to one Canva account. AITPBD manages this through an official team, so your seat is exclusive to you — others in the team don't affect your designs or brand kit. Your designs are private to your own account within the team." },
  { q: "Does Canva Pro include Canva Docs and Canva Websites?", a: "Yes. Canva Pro includes all Canva products — Canva Design, Canva Docs (AI-powered document creation), Canva Websites (publish a website directly from a Canva design), Canva Presentations, and Canva Video. Pro features apply across all of them, giving you an all-in-one creative suite." },
  { q: "Is Canva Pro worth it for Bangladeshi freelancers and students?", a: "Absolutely. For freelancers, Canva Pro pays for itself with the first client project — professional designs worth ৳3,000–10,000 in design fees take 30 minutes. For students, the presentation templates and academic design tools eliminate the need for a graphic designer for assignments and group projects. At ৳350/month from AITPBD, it's the most cost-effective design tool available." },
  { q: "Can I download Canva designs without a watermark?", a: "Yes. Canva Free watermarks premium elements in downloaded files. Canva Pro removes all watermarks from every premium element — your downloads are clean, professional files in PNG, JPG, PDF, MP4, and GIF formats. You can also download in multiple resolutions and file types simultaneously with Canva Pro." },
