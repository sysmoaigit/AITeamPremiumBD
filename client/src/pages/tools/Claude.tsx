const CLAUDE_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is Claude Extended Thinking and when should I use it?", a: "Extended Thinking is Claude's deep reasoning mode — it gives Claude more 'thinking time' to work through complex problems step-by-step before answering. Use it for difficult coding problems, multi-step mathematical proofs, complex analysis tasks, and strategic decisions where accuracy matters more than speed. It's similar to ChatGPT's o3/o4-mini reasoning models." },
  { q: "How does the 200,000 token context window help me?", a: "The 200K context window means Claude can read and analyse approximately 150,000 words in a single conversation. This lets you upload entire research papers, large codebases, complete books, and lengthy legal documents. ChatGPT Plus has 128K tokens. For Bangladeshi students writing thesis with many references, or developers reviewing large codebases, this is a massive advantage." },
  { q: "Is Claude better than ChatGPT for writing?", a: "Claude is widely considered the best AI for long-form writing quality — essays, reports, creative content, and professional documents. Claude writes in a more natural, human-like style with less 'AI tone'. For coding, both ChatGPT and Claude are excellent. For academic writing and analysis, most users prefer Claude. For custom GPTs and plugins, ChatGPT wins." },
  { q: "Can Claude read and analyse PDF documents?", a: "Yes. Claude Pro can upload and analyse PDF files, Word documents, images, and spreadsheets. With the 200K context window, Claude can read documents up to approximately 500 pages in a single session. This is perfect for Bangladeshi students analysing research papers, lawyers reviewing contracts, or businesses processing reports." },
  { q: "What is Claude Projects and how does it help business users?", a: "Claude Projects lets you create dedicated workspaces for different clients or tasks, with persistent instructions and uploaded documents. For example, a marketing agency can create separate projects for each client with their brand guidelines, tone of voice, and target audience uploaded — Claude remembers this context every time." },
  { q: "How does Claude handle Bangla language tasks?", a: "Claude Sonnet 4 generates high-quality Bangla text — for academic writing, business emails, social media content, and customer service responses. Claude understands Bangla prompts (you can write instructions in Bangla) and responds accurately. It handles both formal literary Bangla and everyday conversational Bangla well." },
  { q: "What's the difference between Claude Shared and Claude Personal plan?", a: "The Shared plan (৳599/mo) gives you access via a shared account — you use the full Claude Pro features but share the account with a small number of other users. The Personal plan (৳2,400/mo) upgrades your own email address to Claude Pro — fully private, no sharing, and your data stays linked to your own Anthropic account." },
  { q: "Is there a usage limit on Claude Pro?", a: "Claude Pro gives you approximately 5× more usage than the free tier, which handles all normal workloads. Heavy usage (sending 100+ long messages per day) may hit soft limits during peak hours, causing a temporary slowdown. For most students, freelancers, and professionals using Claude for daily work, the Pro limit is more than sufficient." },
  { q: "Can I use Claude for coding projects in multiple files?", a: "Yes. Claude Pro with Extended Thinking can handle large multi-file codebases. You can paste multiple files into a single conversation and ask Claude to understand the codebase structure, find bugs, or add new features. For Bangladeshi developers working on large projects, this makes Claude an excellent alternative to GitHub Copilot for code review and architecture discussions." },
  { q: "How fast is delivery for Claude Pro from AI Team Premium BD?", a: "For the Shared plan, delivery is 5–15 minutes after payment confirmation on WhatsApp. For the Personal plan (upgrade to your own account), delivery takes 2–4 hours as we need to process the upgrade through official channels. Both plans include a 30-day replacement warranty and 24/7 WhatsApp support in Bangla and English." },
  { q: "Does Claude Pro include access to all Claude models?", a: "Claude Pro gives access to Claude Sonnet 4 — Anthropic's current most capable model — with Extended Thinking enabled. It also allows switching to Claude Haiku for faster responses. As Anthropic releases new models (Claude Opus 4, etc.), Pro subscribers get priority access before free users." },
