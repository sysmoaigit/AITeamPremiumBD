      extendedFaqs={[
        { q: "What is the difference between Google AI Pro and Gemini Advanced?", a: "Google AI Pro (formerly Google One AI Premium) is a bundle that includes Gemini Advanced (Gemini 2.5 Pro Ultra), NotebookLM Plus, Imagen 4 image generation, Veo 2 video generation, AND 2TB Google Drive storage. Gemini Advanced alone is just the chat interface — Google AI Pro includes everything." },
        { q: "How many images can I generate with Google AI Pro per day?", a: "With Google AI Pro, you get access to Imagen 4 with approximately 50 images per day. This is significantly more than the free tier (1–2/day). The images are high resolution and best-in-class for accurate text rendering within images." },
        { q: "What is NotebookLM Plus and how does it help Bangladesh students?", a: "NotebookLM Plus lets you upload up to 500 research sources (PDFs, web pages, YouTube videos) per notebook. It answers questions about your sources, creates mind maps, and generates 'Audio Overviews' — AI-generated podcast conversations summarising your research. Perfect for BD students doing thesis or assignment research." },
        { q: "Can Google AI Pro generate videos?", a: "Yes. Google AI Pro includes Veo 2, Google DeepMind's video generation model. You can generate up to approximately 5 videos per day, each up to 8 seconds long at 1080p resolution. Veo 2 supports both text-to-video and image-to-video with camera movement control." },
        { q: "Does Google AI Pro include Gmail and Docs AI?", a: "Yes, the Personal Seat plan includes Gemini integration in Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. This means you can have AI draft emails, summarise documents, generate spreadsheet formulas, and create presentation content directly inside your Google Workspace apps." },
        { q: "Is Google AI Pro better than ChatGPT for Bangla language?", a: "Google AI Pro (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and ChatGPT are both excellent at Bangla. However, Gemini has a slight edge for Bangla due to Google's extensive multilingual training data. For document reading and research with NotebookLM, Google AI Pro is clearly better. For coding and custom assistants, ChatGPT has more ecosystem maturity." },
        { q: "What is the 2TB Google Drive storage useful for in Bangladesh?", a: "With 2TB Google Drive storage (included in the Personal Seat plan), Bangladeshi professionals can backup all business documents, photos, videos, and project files — eliminating the risk of local hard drive failure. 2TB can store approximately 500,000 photos, 100+ hours of 1080p video, or hundreds of thousands of documents. It also integrates with Google Photos, giving you unlimited photo backup." },
        { q: "How does Imagen 4 compare to Midjourney for Bangladeshi users?", a: "Imagen 4 is Google's best text-to-image model — particularly strong at accurate text rendering within images (a weakness for most competitors), photorealistic product photography, and following precise prompts. Midjourney v7 generally produces more artistic, diverse, and visually stunning outputs for creative work. For e-commerce product images with accurate Bangla text overlays, Imagen 4 wins. For artistic and creative imagery, Midjourney wins." },
        { q: "What is the difference between Google AI Pro Shared and Personal plans?", a: "The Shared Seat (৳449/mo) gives you full Gemini 2.5 Pro features, Imagen 4, Veo 2, NotebookLM Plus, and 2TB Drive — through a shared infrastructure. The Personal Seat (৳1,299/mo) upgrades your own Google account, giving you Gemini integration in your personal Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Slides — plus all the AI features on your private Google account." },
        { q: "Can I use Google AI Pro to build a research podcast for my class?", a: "Yes. NotebookLM Plus's Audio Overview feature generates a realistic podcast-style conversation where two AI hosts discuss and summarise your uploaded research materials. You upload your lecture notes or research papers, and NotebookLM creates an audio podcast you can listen to while commuting or studying. Bangladeshi students and educators find this excellent for creating supplementary study audio." },
        { q: "How is Google AI Pro delivered by AITPBD?", a: "Shared Seat (৳449/mo): we deliver login credentials within 5–15 minutes of payment on WhatsApp. Personal Seat (৳1,299/mo): we need your Google account email and process the Google One AI Premium upgrade within 2–4 hours. You'll receive a Google confirmation email and your account immediately shows Gemini Advanced enabled with 2TB storage." },
