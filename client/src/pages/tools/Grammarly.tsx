  { q: "GrammarlyGO কী?", a: "GrammarlyGO হলো Grammarly-র generative AI feature। এটি পুরো paragraph rewrite করতে, emails draft করতে এবং context-aware suggestions দিতে পারে — শুধু একটি prompt দিলেই হয়।" },
  { q: "Grammarly কোথায় কোথায় কাজ করে?", a: "Grammarly Premium Chrome extension হিসেবে Gmail, Google Docs, Twitter/X, LinkedIn এবং যেকোনো website-এ কাজ করে। আলাদা desktop app আছে Windows ও Mac-এর জন্য। Microsoft Word ও Outlook-এ native add-in আছে।" },

];

const GRAMMARLY_EXTENDED_FAQS = [
  { q: "Can Grammarly check Bangla language writing?", a: "Grammarly is designed exclusively for English. It does not check Bangla or other languages — if you write in Bangla, Grammarly will flag the text as errors. Grammarly is the right tool for any English writing task: emails, reports, essays, and content. For Bangla writing assistance, use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini." },
  { q: "Is Grammarly Premium better than ChatGPT for English proofreading?", a: "They serve different purposes. Grammarly is the best tool for real-time grammar checking as you type — it works inline in Gmail, Google Docs, Word, and any browser. ChatGPT is better for full rewrites and generating new content. For most Bangladeshi professionals, Grammarly as a typing companion + ChatGPT for content generation is the ideal combination." },
  { q: "Does Grammarly work in Google Docs?", a: "Yes. The Grammarly Chrome extension works directly inside Google Docs, showing inline suggestions as you type — you don't need to copy-paste text. It also works in Gmail, Google Forms, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, Outlook Web, and virtually any text input field in Chrome. The desktop app handles Microsoft Word and Outlook." },
  { q: "What is Grammarly's Tone Detector and why is it useful for BD professionals?", a: "Grammarly's Tone Detector analyses your writing and tells you how it will sound to readers — formal, informal, confident, tentative, friendly, aggressive, etc. For Bangladeshi professionals writing to international clients, the tone detector flags emails that might sound 'too aggressive' or 'uncertain' — helping you calibrate your communication for Western business norms where directness and confidence are valued." },
  { q: "How does Grammarly help with academic writing at Bangladeshi universities?", a: "For university students, Grammarly Premium offers academic-style guidance — it can be set to 'Academic' writing goal, which enforces formal vocabulary, flags colloquialisms, and checks for plagiarism. Many Bangladeshi private universities accept Grammarly's plagiarism score as a self-certification tool. For thesis and research paper writing, Grammarly is essential for non-native English writers aiming for high standards." },
  { q: "Can I use Grammarly on my mobile phone?", a: "Yes. Grammarly has an iOS and Android keyboard that works system-wide — in WhatsApp, email apps, LinkedIn, Twitter, and any app where you type. The Grammarly keyboard replaces your standard keyboard and shows grammar and spelling suggestions in real-time on mobile. For Bangladeshi professionals writing English messages on the go, this is extremely useful." },
  { q: "What is the Writing Goals feature in Grammarly?", a: "Writing Goals lets you tell Grammarly who you're writing for and why: Audience (general public, expert, knowledgeable), Formality (formal, informal), Domain (academic, business, creative, casual), Tone (informative, analytical, persuasive). Once set, Grammarly tailors all its suggestions to match your specific writing context — making suggestions appropriate for a USAID report completely different from a casual blog post." },
  { q: "How is Grammarly Premium delivered by AITPBD?", a: "Grammarly Premium from AITPBD is upgraded directly on your own Grammarly account — we need your Grammarly email address. Delivery takes 1–2 hours after payment confirmation on WhatsApp. Your existing documents, account settings, and history are preserved. The upgrade is official and comes with a 30-day replacement warranty." },
