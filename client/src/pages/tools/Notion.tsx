const NOTION_FAQS = [
  { q: "What is Notion AI and what can it do inside my workspace?", a: "Notion AI is an AI assistant built directly into your Notion pages and databases. It can: draft content from prompts, summarise long documents, extract action items from meeting notes, translate pages, improve or rewrite existing text, auto-fill database properties from text, brainstorm ideas, and answer questions about your workspace content. Unlike ChatGPT (a separate app), Notion AI works inside your existing workspace — your notes, documents, and databases." },
  { q: "Is Notion good for Bangladeshi students for study notes?", a: "Notion is the best all-in-one study tool for Bangladeshi university students. Create linked databases for every subject, add lecture notes with AI summaries, build a master revision wiki where concepts link to each other, and use Kanban boards for assignment tracking. Notion AI can summarise 30-page lecture notes into a concise revision guide in Bangla in seconds — work that would take hours manually." },
  { q: "What is the difference between Notion AI Team Seat and Personal Seat?", a: "The Team Seat (৳450/mo) adds your account to a shared Notion workspace — you get full Notion Plus features (unlimited pages, blocks, file uploads) plus Notion AI. Your personal pages are private within the workspace. The Personal Seat (৳1,800/mo) upgrades your own Notion account directly — fully private, your own workspace with admin control, custom domain for published pages." },
  { q: "Can I publish a website from Notion for free?", a: "Yes. Any Notion page can be published as a public website with a Notion subdomain (yourname.notion.site). With Notion Plus (included in our plans), you can add a custom domain. This is popular for Bangladeshi freelancers publishing portfolios, consultants creating client-facing project hubs, and educators building course landing pages — without needing web hosting." },
  { q: "How does Notion AI Fill Properties work for databases?", a: "AI Fill Properties is one of Notion's unique AI features. When you have a database (e.g., a contacts database or product catalog), Notion AI can automatically fill or generate property values based on other fields. For example: 'Generate a 1-sentence description for each product based on the product name and category' — AI fills 100 rows instantly. This is extremely useful for content management, research databases, and CRM-style workflows." },
  { q: "Can Notion replace Jira, Asana, and Trello for project management?", a: "Yes, for most small to medium teams. Notion Kanban boards, timeline views, and database filters replicate core project management features. You can build sprint boards, milestone trackers, bug trackers, and resource management tools in Notion. The key advantage is everything connects — your project board links to your meeting notes, which link to your product specs, all in one workspace. For advanced features like automated Jira integrations, dedicated PM tools still have an edge." },
  { q: "How does Notion compare to Obsidian for note-taking?", a: "Notion and Obsidian serve different needs. Obsidian is a local-only, markdown-based tool with a powerful graph view — better for personal knowledge management and privacy-focused users. Notion is cloud-based, more collaborative, has built-in databases and project management, and now has AI. For Bangladeshi users who want team collaboration, database features, and public website publishing, Notion wins. For personal knowledge management and offline-first usage, Obsidian is strong." },
  { q: "Can I use Notion offline in Bangladesh?", a: "Notion has a desktop app (Mac and Windows) and mobile apps that cache recently viewed pages for offline reading. However, creating or editing pages requires an internet connection for syncing. For Bangladeshi users with inconsistent internet, this is a limitation. If you need a fully offline note-taking tool, consider Obsidian. For team collaboration and AI features, Notion's internet requirement is standard for cloud collaboration tools." },
  { q: "Does Notion AI work in Bangla for Bangladeshi users?", a: "Yes. Notion AI can write, translate, and summarise content in Bangla. You can give prompts in Bangla ('এই বৈঠকের নোটগুলো সংক্ষিপ্ত করো' = 'Summarise these meeting notes') and Notion AI responds in Bangla. For Bangladeshi teams wanting to build knowledge bases or internal documentation in Bangla, Notion AI handles this naturally." },
  { q: "How many pages and blocks can I create with the Notion Plus plan?", a: "Notion Plus (included in both our Team and Personal seat plans) has unlimited pages, unlimited blocks, and unlimited file uploads up to 5MB per file. There is no cap on how much content you create. Free Notion limits you to 1,000 blocks total — which you'd hit within a week of serious use. Plus removes this limit permanently." },
  { q: "Can Notion integrate with other tools I use?", a: "Yes. Notion has native integrations with Slack (send notifications), GitHub (link pull requests to tasks), Jira (sync issues), Google Drive (embed files), Calendly (embed booking), Figma (embed designs), and many more. The Notion API allows custom integrations with any tool that has an API. For Bangladeshi teams using a mix of tools, Notion serves as the central hub that connects everything." },
