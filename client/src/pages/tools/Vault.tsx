const VAULT_FAQS = [
  { q: "What exactly is included in the AI Tools Vault bundle?", a: "The Vault bundle includes: (1) ChatGPT Plus — GPT-4o, Advanced Voice Mode, image generation, Canvas, Deep Research, 5-hour video analysis; (2) Claude Pro — Claude Sonnet 4, Extended Thinking, 200K context, document analysis; (3) Gemini Advanced — Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M context, Deep Research, Gemini Live voice, Imagen 4 image generation. All three in a single WhatsApp order." },
  { q: "How much do I save with the Vault bundle vs buying separately?", a: "Separately: ChatGPT Plus (৳399) + Claude Pro (৳599) + Gemini Advanced (৳449) = ৳1,447/month. The Vault bundle is ৳1,990/month. You pay ৳543 more, but get dedicated consolidated support, priority delivery for all three, and a single WhatsApp channel for all issues. For professionals who need all three tools daily, the convenience alone justifies the difference." },
  { q: "Why would I need all three AI tools — aren't they all similar?", a: "Each model has different strengths. ChatGPT: best ecosystem, custom GPTs, plugins, and code interpreter. Claude: best long-form writing quality and 200K context for documents. Gemini: real-time Google data, Workspace integration, and Imagen 4 image generation. Power users often use all three — ChatGPT for coding, Claude for writing, Gemini for research. The Vault lets you use the best model for each task." },
  { q: "How are the three tools delivered after payment?", a: "After payment confirmation on WhatsApp, we deliver all three tools within a maximum of 6 hours total. Typically ChatGPT and Gemini shared seats are delivered within 5–15 minutes, and Claude within 30 minutes. We deliver each tool's credentials separately via WhatsApp as they're confirmed. The entire process usually completes in 1–2 hours." },
  { q: "Can I use all three AI tools on the same device?", a: "Yes. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all run in the browser (chat.openai.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com) and have mobile apps. You can have all three open in different browser tabs or switch between apps freely. Some users open all three simultaneously to compare answers to the same question." },
  { q: "What is the warranty for each tool in the bundle?", a: "Each of the three tools in the Vault bundle comes with a separate 30-day replacement warranty. If any single tool stops working (account issue, access problem), we replace that tool independently — you don't have to reorder the whole bundle. Our consolidated WhatsApp support handles issues for all three tools through a single channel." },
  { q: "Does the Vault bundle include Gemini's 2TB Google Drive storage?", a: "The Vault bundle includes the Shared Seat versions of all three tools. The Gemini Shared Seat gives you full Gemini Advanced AI features but does not include the 2TB personal Google Drive storage (which requires a Personal Seat upgrade to your own Google account). For the personal Google Drive storage, you would need the Gemini Personal plan." },
  { q: "Which tool in the Vault is best for which tasks?", a: "Best for coding: ChatGPT (Canvas, Code Interpreter, GitHub Copilot-style completion). Best for writing long documents: Claude (200K context, superior prose). Best for research with sources: Gemini (Deep Research, Google Search integration). Best for image generation: Gemini (Imagen 4, ~50 images/day) or ChatGPT (GPT-image-1). Best for reasoning: Claude (Extended Thinking) or ChatGPT (o4-mini). Best for voice: ChatGPT (Advanced Voice Mode)." },
  { q: "Is the AI Tools Vault suitable for a business team in Bangladesh?", a: "The Vault bundle provides Shared Seats — they are set up for individual professional or student use. For a business team needing multiple seats across multiple team members, we recommend ordering multiple bundles (one per person) or contacting us for custom business arrangements. The bundle is most suited for individual power users or small freelance teams." },
  { q: "Can I upgrade any of the three tools to a Personal Seat later?", a: "Yes. At any time, you can upgrade any of the three Vault tools to a Personal Seat (your own account). Contact us on WhatsApp and we'll provide a price for the upgrade. You continue using the other shared tools while we set up the personal version. Many users start with the Vault bundle and upgrade the tools they use most." },
  { q: "Are there any usage limits on the Vault bundle tools?", a: "The tools in the Vault bundle are the standard Shared Seat tiers with all Pro features enabled. Usage limits match the standard Pro tiers for each tool: ChatGPT Plus (unlimited GPT-4o for normal use), Claude Pro (5× more than free), Gemini Advanced (unlimited for normal use). Heavy-use power users who send 200+ long messages per day on a single tool may experience occasional slowdowns during peak hours." },
