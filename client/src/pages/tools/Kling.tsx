      extendedFaqs={[
        { q: "How many videos can I generate per month with Kling Standard (৳599)?", a: "Kling Standard includes 660 credits per month. Each 5-second HD video uses about 10 credits, so you can generate approximately 60 five-second clips per month. Longer clips use proportionally more credits — a 30-second video uses ~60 credits. The Pro plan (৳1,799/mo, 3,000 credits) generates ~300 five-second clips per month." },
        { q: "What is special about Kling 2.0 Master compared to earlier Kling versions?", a: "Kling 2.0 Master is Kuaishou's highest quality model — producing significantly smoother motion, more realistic physics, better adherence to text prompts, and higher fidelity character consistency than Kling 1.0 or 1.5. It matches or exceeds Sora (OpenAI) for motion realism in benchmark tests, particularly for fast-moving subjects and water/fluid dynamics." },
        { q: "Can Kling AI generate videos longer than 10 seconds?", a: "Yes — this is Kling's unique differentiator. Kling supports video generation up to 3 minutes in total length through its video extension feature. You start with a 5–10 second clip, then extend it continuously. This enables documentary-style sequences, product showcase videos, and educational content that most AI video tools (limited to 8–10 seconds) cannot produce." },
        { q: "How does face swap in Kling AI work?", a: "Kling's face swap feature lets you replace a character's face in any video with another face — from a photo you upload. The AI maintains realistic lighting, shadows, and skin texture matching the original video. This is used for brand ambassador videos (put a client's face on a model), educational content, and entertainment. Results are high-quality and smooth in motion." },
        { q: "Is Kling better than Runway for social media video creation?", a: "They excel in different areas. Kling is better for: longer clips (up to 3 minutes vs Runway's 10 seconds), face swap and lip sync features, and higher frame rate (30fps vs 24fps) for smoother social media video. Runway is better for: professional VFX workflows (inpainting, motion tracking, background removal, Act One character animation), background removal, and video-to-video style transfer. For pure social media content creation, Kling offers more value per taka." },
        { q: "What camera movements can I control in Kling AI?", a: "Kling's camera control system supports: pan (left/right), tilt (up/down), zoom in/out, orbit around a subject, tracking shots (following a moving subject), and push/pull (moving toward/away from subject). You specify camera movements in your prompt alongside the scene description. This gives cinematic-quality camera work in AI-generated videos without needing to manually animate anything." },
        { q: "Can I use Kling AI for Bangladeshi social media content?", a: "Yes. Kling excels at generating culturally relevant content — Bangladeshi street scenes, traditional settings, festivals, and contemporary Dhaka life all generate accurately from text prompts. The 1080p 30fps output meets the quality requirements for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. Many Bangladeshi content creators and agencies use Kling for consistent, high-volume social content." },
        { q: "What is Motion Brush in Kling and when do I use it?", a: "Motion Brush lets you paint over specific areas of your image before video generation to indicate where and how motion should occur. For example: paint over water to make it flow, over trees to make them sway, over a character's hair to create wind movement — while keeping the rest of the frame static. This gives precise control over which parts of the scene animate, producing more intentional and professional results." },
        { q: "Does Kling AI have lip sync for Bangla audio?", a: "Yes. Kling's lip sync feature can synchronise a character's mouth movements to any audio, including Bangla speech. Upload a video clip and a Bangla audio track, and Kling generates mouth animation that matches the words. For Bangladeshi educational content creators and media producers making Bangla-dubbed content, this is a powerful tool." },
        { q: "How is Kling AI delivered from AITPBD?", a: "The Shared plan (৳599/mo) provides credentials within 5–15 minutes of WhatsApp payment confirmation. The Personal Pro plan (৳1,799/mo) is set up on your dedicated account within 2–4 hours. Both plans include a 30-day replacement warranty and 24/7 WhatsApp support in Bangla and English. You access Kling at klingai.com or the Kling mobile app." },
        { q: "Can I use Kling API for my app or website?", a: "Yes. The Pro plan includes Kling API access, allowing you to integrate video generation directly into your application or website. This is useful for Bangladeshi developers building video-generation SaaS products, content platforms, or marketing automation tools. The API returns video URLs you can embed or process programmatically. Contact us on WhatsApp for enterprise API pricing." },
